# Personal C++ Revision Solution
Going over C++ for the first time in like 2 years, hoping to remember what I knew and learn more about the language for games dev among other things. This is entirely designed as a personal repo but it open to the public if people want to take a look. There won't be anything ground breaking in here as it is just for learning really...
